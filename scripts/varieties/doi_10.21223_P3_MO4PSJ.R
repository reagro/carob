"Dataset for: Participatory Varietal Selection of 5 late blight resistant clones (B1C5) in the localities of Alacoto, La Soledad and Macullida in La Libertad, Peru.The Mother and Baby (M&B) trial methodology was adapted by CIP for Participatory Variety Selection (PVS) through decentralized evaluation networks and multi-year evaluations in potato growing areas in the Andean region. The M&B trial design encourages active participation of farmers through the application of treatments through systematic evaluations and selections of treatments in their own plots called \"Baby trials\" (i.e. farmer managed trials) and in fields with an experimental design called \"Mother trials\" (i.e. researcher managed trials).Objective: Analyze characteristics, attributes and preferences that men and women have when selecting a new potato variety at the phase of flowering and harvesting.A M&B trial was performed to evaluate 11 clones with late blight resistance in the localities of Alacoto, La Soledad, and Macullida, in the provinces of Sanchez Carrion and Pataz in La Libertad department, Peru. The trial design was a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replicates for Mother trials and 3 replicates during 2013-2014. In this experiment characteristics of plant (size, type of foliage), yield, desirable quality, pest and disease resistance during flowering and harvesting were evaluated. Total number of participants flowering phase was 7 (men=3 and women=4), 11 (men=7, women =4) and 10 (men=5, women =5) in the localities of Alacoto, La Soledad, and Macullida respectively.  Total number of participants at harvesting phase was 15 (men=8 and women=7), 19 (men=5, women =14), 18 (men=12, women =6) in the localities of Alacoto, La Soledad, and Macullida respectively. Additionally, an organoleptic evaluation was assessed at harvesting to evaluate appearance, taste and texture. The number of panelists was 14 (men=8, women=6), 10 (men=5, women=5) and 14 (men=8, women=6) for the organoleptic evaluation to each locality respectively."
