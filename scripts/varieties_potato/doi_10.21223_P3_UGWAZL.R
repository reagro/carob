"In anticipation of the effects of global warming on potato cultivation in both tropical and subtropical environments. Since 2004, efforts have turned to the development of a new group in Population B with improved adaptation to warm environments, resistance to late blight and virus, mid-season maturity (90 day growing period under short-day length conditions), adaptation to  mid elevations, low glycoalkaloids content, along with economically important traits such as high tuber yield, quality for table and industry. And so group LBHT of population B was developed, denominated LBHT because of its late blight and heat tolerance.  All trials were conducted in  randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 2-4  replicates or in simple lattice design at Oxapampa, located at 1810 masl in Pasco in the Eastern mountain ranges facing the Amazon. The trials were established at Oxapampa due to high disease pressure of late blight, disease endemic, highly favorable for disease development and severity during the rainy periods  in these areas from 2005 to 2008."
