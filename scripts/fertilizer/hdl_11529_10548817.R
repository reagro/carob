  Wheat productivity in eastern Indo-Gangetic plain is sub-optimal that can largely be attributed to delayed wheat sowing and use of late sown varieties. Ideal time of sowing 
  wheat in eastern India is first fortnight of November but in general, it gets delayed by 15-25 days. 
  This delay puts farmers in a situation where they tend to prefer late sown varieties whose potential 
  yields are low. By 2020, more than half wheat farmers in Bihar more than one third in eastern 
  Uttar Pradesh were using late sown wheat varieties. To validate the effect of timely sowing and 
  comparative performance of long and short duration varieties, multi-location on-farm trials were 
  conducted continuously over five years starting from 2016-17. Krishi Vigyan Kendras, district-level 
  extension centre of national agriculture research and extension system were involved in the process of
  evidence generation. Ten districts so ten centres were selected in a way that all agro-climatic zones of
  this area is covered. There were five treatments of sowing windows – 01 to 10 November, 11 – 20 November,
  21 to 30 November, 01 – 15 December and 16 – 31 December. Varietal performance was compared in T3, T4 and 
  T5 as short duration varieties can’t be sown before 20 November. There is asymmetry in distribution of 
  samples within treatments and over years. That happened as trial was in farmer’s participatory mode and 
  numbers were dependent completely on willingness of farmers to participate. Altogether, the trial was 
  conducted at 3735 sites and we captured 60 variables including 
  yield and yield attributing traits. (2022-10-28)
