    CIMMYT annually distributes improved germplasm developed by its researchers and partners in international nurseries trials and experiments. The High Temperature Wheat Yield Trial (HTWYT) is a replicated yield trial that contains spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) germplasm adapted to Mega-environment 1 (ME1) which represents high temperature areas.
